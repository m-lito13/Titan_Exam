DB

It was tested on MySql server (running as docker container locvally - image taken by command 
docker pull mysql:latest)
 
Folder DB_Dumps contains Dump of data and schema 
(it contains one table 'orders') 
.env file contains params (starting by DB_*) for connnect to DB which can be changed accordingly 

Running

1. Create local copy of the repository 
2. start 
	npm install 
3. start (as typescript) 
	npm start 
	
It will start on by default port 3001 (to change port - in .env file there should be changed APP_USE_PORT value)

sample requests(in curl format) can be found in folder API_Requests
